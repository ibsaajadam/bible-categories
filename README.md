Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/bible-verses-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd bible-verses-app
<<<<<<< HEAD
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will now be running at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works
Home Page
The home page displays clickable category cards.
Clicking on a category displays the corresponding Bible verses with their references and versions.
Components
BibleCategory.tsx: Displays clickable category cards, with visual feedback for selected/deselected categories.
VerseList.tsx: Renders the Bible verses for the selected category, including the reference and version (e.g., NIV, KJV).
TypeScript Integration
TypeScript is used to define types for props and data structures.

Example:

typescript
Copy code
interface Verse {
  verse: string;
  reference: string;
  version: string;
}

interface VerseListProps {
  verses: Verse[];
}
Data Source
Bible verses are stored in bibleVerses.json in a format that includes the verse text, reference (e.g., John 3:16), and version (e.g., NIV, KJV).
Responsive Design
The app uses Bootstrap's grid system for a responsive layout.
Cards adapt to screen sizes, displaying 5 across on desktop, 3 on tablets, and 2 on mobile.

How It Works
1. Home Page
The home page displays Bible categories as cards.
Clicking on a card displays Bible verses related to that category.
2. Components
BibleCategory.tsx: Displays clickable category cards. When a card is clicked, it changes color to indicate selection.
VerseList.tsx: Shows the Bible verses for the selected category, including the reference and version.
3. TypeScript Integration
Types are defined using interface, ensuring that props passed between components are correctly typed.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
interface Verse {
  verse: string;
  reference: string;
  version: string;
}

interface VerseListProps {
  verses: Verse[];
}
4. Data Source
Bible verses and their categories are stored in a JSON file (bibleVerses.json).
Each verse contains the text, reference, and version (e.g., NIV, KJV).
5. Responsive Design
Using Bootstrap classes and CSS, the app is designed to be responsive across different device sizes.
